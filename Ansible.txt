Configuration management tools help to perform changes on your infrastructure.

Whenever we install ansible on a machine, it is called Ansible Controller.

Ansible has the capability to connect to all the prod servers and then it can run the activities on all servers seamlessly without logging into theprod servers.
Protocol we us to connect to a machine is SSH or rdp. Ansible also uses SSH to connect to prod servers to perform all the tasks.
We need to maintain our host list on Ansible controller for connecting to machines using SSH protcol.
Ansible is agent less. We need nnot install anything on othr servers. SSH is enough which is a default in any linux machine.
In ansible we use yml syntax.
We can create a AWS instances as well using Ansible.

After installing ansible we need to check if following are runnign or not:
1. SSH - service sshd status
2. Credentails - use aws script to create credentials if using EC2 instances	.
3. Hosts

There is another type of authentication called SSH keys. Rather than exchanging username, passwords we just exchange the keys.
ssh-keygen is the command to generate keys.leave everythnig empty then it generate keys. Now, we have to share the public key with the hosts.
Now run: ssh-copy-id <IP_Address> - this copies public key to remote machine.
Once done ping and check without -u & -k. It connets without asking for username and password.
Dis-Advantages:
We need to manually copy sh keys to all the servers.
Any person can access the prod machines can do anything.
There are security challanges.

Only go for username and password authentication if not EC2 machines.

If we are using ec2 machines as our hosts, we can also connect to them from controller using pem keys insetad of username/pwd or SSH key based authentication. For that we need to do following:
Update ansible.cfg with private_key_file=<path_of_key_file>
In the inventory we need to give following after host 
ansible_ssh_user=ubuntu ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
Example: 
[web]
IP-Addr1 ansible_ssh_user=ubuntu ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
IP-Addr2
   .
   .
   .
IP-AddrN


Add IP Addresses of the host in /etc/ansible/hosts of controller.
It is always agood practice to have your own host file instead of common host file. Create a host file as defined below:
[web]
IP-Addr1 ansible_ssh_user=devops ansible_ssh_pass=devops
IP-Addr2
   .
   .
   .
IP-AddrN
and use the command - ansible web -i <file_name> -m ping -u devops -k
uncomment host_key_checking in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
We can also customize ansible.cfg. whenever we run anisble commands it first goes to ansible.cfg. Since, everybody uses the same file, it is not a good practice to edit that file. Instead, copy that file to your path so that it takes ansible.cfg from your path or the path where you copied. Now you can change the required parameters like inventory in the config file.
ansible all -m ping -u devops -k
ansible all -m ping -u devops -k -vvv, it gives the log. number of v gives that many number of lines.
ansible all -m ping -u devops -k --limit "IP_ADDRESS" - To limit the ip address.

Terminology:
Module: In linux terminoligy we call it as command
Playbook: The yml file that we prepare with instructions is playbook. In linux we call it as shell script.
Inventory: List of ip addresses
Config file: Default ansible config file. always have your own copy of config and create backup of the same before editing original file.
In few cases if host do not have open ssh then add ---> ansible web -i <file_name> -m ping -u devops -k -c paramiko to the command.

ansible all -a "touch /tmp/ravifile" -u devops -k

If ansible_ssh_user=devops ansible_ssh_pass=devops is added in inv file no need to give -u devops -k in the comand.

If we specify username and password in the inv file and if we try to isntall software on hosts, it will fail becasue we can only install softwares using root user. So, we need to give -b in the command.
ansible all -b -a "apt-get install nginx -y" --limit "IP_Addr"
--limit is very inportant. If we use that we can run commands on single host and if we feel everything is fine then we can go-ahead to install on all server hosts.

ansible all -m setup gives all the information of remote sysytems under ansible_facts.

If we want to run multiple tasks at a time we can go for playbook.
It is configuration, deployment and orchesrization language.
At baic level, playbooks can be used to manage configuration of and deployments to remote machines.

Every playbooks starts with --- though it is not mandatory but yml follows this syntax.
-hosts:PROD - checks for the PROD group in our inventory file like where we need to deploy.

to run playbook: ansible-playbook <name>

When we use become: yes in playbook, it converts as root user and then executes tasks to performing system level activities.
copy:
 src: /temp/naresh.txt
 dest: /temp

file:
 path: /tmp/newfolder
 state: directory

file:
 path: /tmp/file.txt
 state: touch

stae absent is used to delete files/folders.
file:
 path: /tmp/file.txt
 state: absent

In ansible we can define variables using vars module:
vars:
  PACKAGE: Classpackage
  X: GM

If we need topring the value of above variables, we need to give {{PACKAGE}}, {{x}}
when we want to use msg multiple times, it consider others as duplicates. it takes the reent one into consideration. if we want to use both we use conditions in ansible.
- hosts: aws
  tasks:
    - name: Run a loop
      debug:
        msg: "{{item}}"
      with_items:
        - one
        - two
        - three
        - Four

- hosts: aws
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: find the files
      find:
        paths: '/opt'
        patterns: "*.log"
      register: out

    - name: remove the files
      file:
        path: "{{item.path}}"
        state: absent
      with_items: "{{out.files}}" 
out is a variable in the ansible where output is saved using register module.

when is the keyword in anisble just like IF block.

ansible doc-l list all the modules of ansible.

Creating AWS instances using ansible playbook:
easy_install pip
pip install awscli
pip install boto
aws --version

Now create a user in aws for command line access. 
go to IAM in aws
goto users --> create user --> uername --> Access type - programatic access ->next -> attach existing policy - ec2full acess -> skip -> Create user.
now run the command "aws configure" and copy access_id, key from aws console
now aws fro mcommand line can communicate to aws console.
now we are ready to run instructions to manage aws from controller.
aws ec2 describe-instances --output table
Running a playbook to create instances in AWS.
vi ec2.yml
- name: Create EC2 Instance
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - ec2:
        key_name: <keyname>
        instance_type: t2.micro
        image: <image_name>
        wait: yes
        group: <security_grp_name>
        count: 2
        vpc_subnet_id: <subnet_id>
        assign_public_ip: yes
        region: <region_name>
      register: out

    - debug:
        msg: "{{out}}"

Ansible Role:
we seggregate play book into several pieces.
